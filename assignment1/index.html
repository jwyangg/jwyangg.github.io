        the experience?</span
      >
      <br />
      The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience
      was the colour palette, it is very fitting for the theme of Summer,
      especially with the imagery of the palm trees at the beach. I then
      realized that there was sound playing, it was a very calm and soft sound
      so I didn’t realize that there was sound at first. The next thing I paid
      attention to is that nothing happened to the experience, I had to initiate
      it by resizing the browser, which opened me to the start button and
      introduced me to the brand “Richard Mille” with the main header “Endless
      Summer.” But it was mainly the visual aesthetics that caught my attention
      at first.

      ☁️Resizing the browser, making it bigger then smaller to watch the
      animation of the sun rising and falling
      <br />
      ☁️Reading the introductory text (invitation to the experience)
      <br />
      ☁️Going through the tutorial
      <br />
      ☁️Moving around the screen to view the full picture, due to the size of
      the browser not containing the full image
      <br />
      ☁️Dragging the wheel to continue through the experience
      <br />
      ☁️Clicking through to “find the secret experience”
      <br />
      ☁️Listening and reading to the section where they included a “poetic
      interlude” (clicking three dots)
      <br />
      ☁️Turned volume to max as advised - holding down on the screen that
      recommended this revealed the sounds of the beach instead of the music
      <br />
      ☁️As 2 minutes hit, I finally made it to the next section

      <span
        >What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?</span
      >
      <br />
      There are three sections to the experience: The Archipelago, The Beach,
      and The City. I spent the most time exploring the first section, The
      Archipelago, as I was still taking time to learn how the webpage operated
      and how the creator was intending it to be interacted. I noticed that
      there were some interactive elements (what they refer to as “secret
      features”), separate to the interaction where the user can click and hold
      down to hear the sound of the scene (rather than the sound that was
      produced from the experience). Because I wasn’t sure of how many
      interactive elements there were I kept clicking around to see what there
      was. Furthermore, upon clicking the three dots, an animation with text
      related to the scene appears. This is in all of the sections, however, I
      spent a lot of time in the first section engaging with it to not miss any
      detail or text. Although, there isn’t a specific element I engaged most
      with, The Archipelago is definitely the overall aspect I spent most time
      engaging with.

        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </span>
      <br />
      The most common action in my two minute interaction was clicking and
      holding on the screen while simultaneously clicking and dragging. I paid
      more attention to clicking and holding, rather than clicking and dragging
      as my main objective from clicking and dragging was to continue holding to
      listen to sounds. So, clicking and dragging was just a side-effect of
      clicking and holding. As previously explained, when clicking and holding,
      the user is able to experience the sound of the scene, instead of the
      music/soundtrack that is provided for the experience. It was the most
      common action because I wanted to see if the audio was looping, or if
      there were any hidden elements from listening to the audio. The sounds
      when clicking and holding include: the beach, the sounds of cars, a person
      skateboarding, etc. essentially common sounds that can be heard from a
      Summer holiday.

      <span>
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interaction
        with the experience?
      </span>
      <br />
      The opening page introduces the user to the brand “Richard Mille.” I am
      already aware that “Richard Mille” is a luxury watch brand, so I was under
      the assumption that this was to introduce a new watch. As you click
      “start”, the user is welcomed with the introductory text that explains the
      website is to tribute the “grand unveiling of the RM 07-01 coloured
      ceramics.” Knowing the brand may be quite important as the introductory
      text does not explain further what the "RM 07-01" is.The main purpose of
      this interactive experience to promote their releasing watch line. They
      have achieved this through an immersive, visually aesthetic, experience
      that mimics and reminisces a “Summer day” for their upcoming release.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal of
        promoting the watch?</span
      >
      <br />
      In order to successfully promote their launch, as it was previously
      mentioned, an immersive, visually aesthetic experience was created. The
      final portion of the webpage links to the main “Richard Mille” website to
      showcase the collection in its entirety. Unlike other promotional
      materials, this webpage does not start by showcasing the product, rather,
      they let the user enjoy the “Summer” experience the interactions
      communicate. After the user experiences all aspects, they are given the
      option to “Discover the RM 07-01”. In the entire webpage experience, there
      includes only one photo of the promotional watch at the very end. This
      visually pleasing experience prompts curiosity of how the aesthetic
      conveys in the watch, thereby prompting audiences to explore the actual
      watch being promoted. Therefore, this primary goal is delivered purely
      after the enjoyment and appreciation of the webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)</span
      >
      <br />
      As this webpage was designed to promote a specific line released by
      “Richard Mille”, it is an experience that is expected to have short-term
      engagement over time. Since, this is a promotional website for the “RM
      07-01:, it would most likely not be used to update audiences on the status
      of any other watch lines, nor will the website be further updated.
      Furthermore, the detailed descriptions and other details are on the actual
      website of “Richard Mille”, instead of this promotional website (Endless
      Summer). Therefore, allowing the conclusion that this is more adapted to
      short-term engagement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </span>
      <br />
      Based on my personal experience, it may be a website that drives users to
      visit multiple times to uncover all the “secret features”, as there are
      multiple layers to explore. This can be assumed by the structure of the
      experience being divided into three sections, creating the assumption that
      there are many hidden details to appreciate, which may be easier
      discovered through multiple visits. The interactive elements, such as
      clicking and holding or dragging, revealing animations/text, encourages
      users to take their time to explore each scene, which may create the
      implication that the website may be better enjoyed in multiple, shorter
      visits, regardless of this website being more adatped to a shorter-term
      engagement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </span>
      <br />
      Likewise, that the webpage is designed for promotional purposes for a
      watch, it takes inspiration from a watch. To navigate through the page,
      the user must turn the dial located at the bottom of the page. Each of the
      indentations and the circle dial, imitates that of a watch face, with the
      time also at the bottom. The dial at the bottom could also be interpreted
      as the side dial on the watch, especially mimicking the turning function
      (to navigate and further advance the page in this instance). The overall,
      colour scheme is also very reminiscent of an art/design style called
      “Memphis Design”. Memphis Design usually refers to architectural elements,
      typically a combination of shapes and bright colours. Upon looking at the
      website that is linked at the end of the experience, it can be observed
      that the watches were, in-fact, inspired from the Memphis Design style.

    <p>
      <span>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </span>
      <br />
      As it was mentioned previously, the references to a physical watch, guide
      user behaviour by allowing the user to progress through the environment.
      If not for the dial, and the movements, the user is unable to progress
      through and experience the entire page. The dial behaves in a similar way
      to a clock ticking, the passing of time and also adjusting the side dial
      of a physical watch to reach the accurate time. Furthermore, if not for
      the interaction with the dial, because the user is unable to progress
      through, the final page leading to the website with the actual watch would
      not be reached, therefore failing to fulfil its role in promoting the
      watch. These elements depict the importance of thematic presentation. It
      not only introduces the aesthetics, but also gives insight on what to
      expect and how to keep everything cohesive. It also elevates the
      experience, opening the doors to more possibilities, while maintaining
      elegance.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?</span
      >
      <br />
      The reference of the watch face/dial communicates the importance of
      cohesion and thematic aesthetics. The high-quality visuals and design with
      the refined aesthetics is very fitting to the luxury watch brand's
      elegance and, yet, the website sparks curiosity and engagement on the
      relevance to the product. Including the discrete reference of the dial,
      located at the bottom of the page, tied the theme together on how this was
      a promotional design for a watch. It helps guide the audience how to feel
      and how a webpage and guide in eliciting certain emotions, also aiding
      with immersion.

      <span>
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?</span
      >
      <br />
      The most frustrating part of the interaction was actually the speed of
      navigation and the size of the browser. Because the webpage would only
      operate when resized into a smaller browser, it felt a bit frustrating
      that the size was so small. Although a part of the experience was to click
      and drag the screen to explore the full picture of the webpage, because I
      personally prefer larger screens, it felt a bit frustrating to look at.
      Furthermore, I wanted to see the bigger picture to see what the scene
      looked like overall, to appreciate the visuals, which was not possible in
      the smaller browser size. In terms of the speed of navigation, sometimes
      the dial would turn a bit slow, so I would have to overextend my movements
      to let the experience continue to the next. I also wanted to go back and
      forth between each section but due to the speed of navigation, it was a
      bit difficult, however, although I found the speed frustrating, I feel as
      though it is fitting for the theme. This is because it seems to be an
      experience to incite calmness and relaxation, so it makes sense to work a
      bit slower.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?</span
      >
      <br />
      Surprisingly, I found the most satisfying part of the interaction resizing
      the browser. It left the strongest impact on me because you would see the
      sun rising and falling. I personally found it very satisfying because I
      have not seen many things like this. I also found it the most satisfying
      because the visuals were very pretty, in my personal opinion, and I really
      like the colour scheme that was used. Although, overall, I found the size
      of the browser frustrating, I really enjoyed watching the sun rising and
      falling. Personally, the visual aesthetics made the experience very
      satisfying to click and explore through.
